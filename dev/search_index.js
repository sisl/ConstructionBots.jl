This system approaches multi-robot assembly planning from a higher level of abstraction and addresses task planning and transit planning but abstracts away the kino-dynamic details of piecing together assemblies.

Wince there are generally far more payloads than robots, individual robots generally have to transport multiple payloads in sequence.\nCollision avoidance with heterogeneous agent geometry and dynamics: How must laden and unloaden robots and robot teams move, subject to motion constraints that depend on the payload size and team configuration, to avoid collision with other robots and the active construction sites in the environment?","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"ConstructionBots.jl","title":"ConstructionBots.jl","text":"ConstructionBots ueses LEGO models to evaluate algorithms.
