# Summary

ConstructionBots is an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator and is 
designed to test algorithms for multi-robot assembly planning. This system
approaches multi-robot assembly planning from a higher level of abstraction and
addresses task planning and transit planning, while abstracting away the kino-
dynamic details of piecing together assemblies. The problems addressed and 
simulated by this package include:
- Transport Team Configuration
- Spatial Layout of the Construction Site
- Sequential Task Allocation and Team Forming
- Collision Avoidance with Heterogenous Agent Geometry and Dynamics

# Statement of need

`ConstructionBots` is a Julia package for multi-robot simulations.
